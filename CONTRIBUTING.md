# Contributing

## Setup

Python 3.9+ is the only requirement. There is no Node dependency and no
bundler — the add-on ships the JavaScript the game runs.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NullSablex/bedrock-soulglass
cd bedrock-soulglass
python tools/check.py     # static analysis
python build.py           # writes dist/
```

To test in game, junction the packs into the game's development folders so it
reads straight from your clone — see
[Installation](https://nullsablex.github.io/bedrock-soulglass/installation/#development-install).
Changes take effect when you re-enter the world; there is no hot reload.

**Turn on Content Log GUI** under Settings → Creator before anything else.
Without it a script error is invisible and you will chase a ghost.

## Before opening a pull request

```bash
python tools/check.py
python build.py
```

Both run in CI, so a failure there is a failure here. `check.py` covers imports
resolving, config keys existing, translation keys present in every language
file, characters that break the in-game font, JSON validity, and side effects
that would throw inside `beforeEvents`.

None of it proves behaviour. **Say in the pull request what you tested in game**,
or say plainly that you did not — an untested change is still worth reviewing,
but the reviewer needs to know which it is.

## Conventions

**Source language is en-US.** Comments, identifiers, the base `.lang` file.

**Player-facing text never sits in the code.** It goes through a translation key
in every `.lang` file. The only exceptions are the map's item name and lore,
which the API refuses to translate.

**Stay inside Latin-1 in displayed text.** Accented letters render fine; a
single character above `U+00FF` makes Minecraft redraw the whole line in a
fallback font that clashes with everything else. `check.py` rejects them.

**Comments explain why, not what.** A comment restating the line below it is
noise and will be removed. A comment recording a constraint the next reader
could not recover on their own is the most valuable thing in the file — most of
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) started as one.

**One responsibility per module.** When a file starts answering two questions,
split it.

## Adding a language

1. Copy `resource_packs/soulglass/texts/en_US.lang` to your language code.
2. Translate the values, leaving the keys untouched.
3. Add the code to `texts/languages.json`.
4. Run `python tools/check.py` — it fails on any key the code uses that your
   file is missing.

Keep the `%s` placeholders and the `§` colour codes. Singular and plural are
separate keys, because a `.lang` file has no plural rules.

## Changing behaviour

If you hit an API constraint — something that does not work the way it should,
or works only under a condition nobody would guess — **write it down in
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)**. That file exists because four
such constraints shaped this entire add-on, and each one cost hours to find.
Rediscovering them is the most expensive thing that can happen to this project.

## Reporting bugs

Use the issue templates. Two things are always needed and rarely volunteered:
the **content log** output, and confirmation that **both packs** are enabled.

Duplication, item loss and theft go through
[Security](SECURITY.md) instead — on a live server, a public report of those is
an exploit handed to everyone reading.

## Releases

Maintainer only:

1. Bump `version` in both manifests.
2. Add the section to `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Tag `vX.Y.Z` and push it.

The workflow verifies the tag matches both manifests, builds the three
packages, and takes the release body from the changelog section for that
version.

## Licence

Contributions are licensed under the [MPL-2.0](LICENSE), like the rest of the
project. In practice: a file you modify stays open; a file you add can be
whatever you like.
