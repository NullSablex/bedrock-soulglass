#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Builds the release packages into dist/.

Three of them, because two different people download this:

    Soulglass_v<version>.mcaddon     both packs; opening it installs the lot
    Soulglass_BP_v<version>.mcpack   behavior pack alone
    Soulglass_RP_v<version>.mcpack   resource pack alone

A player wants the one that just works. A server owner placing each half by
hand wants the halves. Shipping only the combined file forces them to unzip it;
shipping only the halves makes the common case harder than it needs to be.

Python rather than a shell script: Git Bash on Windows has no `zip`, and its
GNU tar cannot produce ZIP archives. `zipfile` is in the standard library and
behaves the same on Windows, Linux and macOS.

Entry names use forward slashes deliberately. PowerShell's Compress-Archive
writes backslashes, which violates the ZIP spec and gets the package rejected
by several clients and by BDS.

Usage:
    python build.py          # the .mcaddon only
    python build.py --all    # all three
